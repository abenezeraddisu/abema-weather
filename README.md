# abema-weather 
The lib file (only) could be found here. There are some drawbacks:
* not supprting Amharic text input (Google's translation API wasn't of an use :( and it was difficult to implement manually.   ) 
* working on letting users submit their own openweather API instead of depending on readily given one. 
* not the smoothest UI. 
* inspired by https://github.com/Rajchowdhury420/Flutter-Weather/blob/master/lib/main.dart, though reimplemented.
